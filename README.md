# Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Tool Used
- Wireshark

## Objective
To understand basic networking concepts and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.

## What Was Done
- Opened Wireshark and selected **wlo1 (Wi-Fi)** interface.
- Captured live network traffic.
- Visited websites to generate traffic.
- Applied protocol filters such as `dns`, `tcp`, and `http`.
- Observed packet details and communication process.

## Key Learnings

### IP Address
- Identifies devices on a network.
- Works like a home address for computers.

### MAC Address
- Unique hardware address of a network device.
- Used for communication within a local network.

### DNS
- Converts website names into IP addresses.
- DNS queries were observed in Wireshark.

### TCP Three-Way Handshake
- TCP establishes connection using:
  - SYN
  - SYN-ACK
  - ACK
- Makes communication reliable.

### TCP vs UDP
- TCP is reliable and ensures delivery.
- UDP is faster but does not guarantee delivery.

### HTTP vs HTTPS
- HTTP data is visible in plain text.
- HTTPS data is encrypted and secure.

### Packet Sniffing
- Packet sniffing means capturing and analyzing network packets.
- Wireshark is used for this purpose.

## Outcome
Ability to analyze and understand network traffic using Wireshark.
